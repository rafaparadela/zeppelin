aboutUs: "Google's services have become synonymous with simple things online. Number of technological innovations and IT industries in which Google is creating new products is enormous. It's hard to get to know all of them, but realistic. This is why people have started to gather in small local groups and share their experience. Later, the following groups have been called Google Developer Groups. GDGs can take many forms -- from just a few people getting together to watch some videos, to large gatherings with demos, tech talks, hackathons and conferences."

We realize that this is pretty short notice so we hope you can help us spread the word! There will be pizza, prizes and a great group of geeks to spend the evening coding with! Even if you don't have an app idea come on in and lend a hand to someone else or maybe find inspiration once you're here!"}
 - {title: "Google Glass", image: "hackathon-1.png", details: "We love wearable computing especially Google Glass for which we want to gather the break up community in order to boost innovation.<br><br>Coding an app on Google Glass needs its Rockstar Dev : the team needs a fast learner with solid skills on Android. He knows his way around Android SDK, already checked the Glass Developement Kit (GDK) quick start guide allowing him to jump start developing an app for Glass.The Designer has the hard task to build the visual identity from the ground up, he has strong UX knowledge and a deep understanding of the new rules set by the Glass. His design skills give him the credibility to decide the most effective UI and the most compelling Glass experience."}
 - {title: "Polymer", image: "hackathon-2.png", details: "Polymer is a library that introduces web components. Web components are small elements on a page that can be extended and incorporated in web applications. The result is an increase in productivity.<br><br>We used Polymer mainly to explore the concept of web components. The transition of Google to material design was also a factor.While the library was never touched by the team, it still was painless to wireframe the application. Later on we incorporated some Polymer components in the design. We didn’t use the full potential of Polymer because of the limited time."}
